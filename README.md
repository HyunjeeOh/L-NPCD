# L-NPCD
Longitudinal nonparametric cognitive diagnosis methods
1. LGNPC-A method
  The algorithm links the data at different time points by using the attribute profiles obtained by using the GNPC method at time t as the initials for the GNPC algorithm at time (t + 1).
2. LGNPC-B method
   The responses across all time points are stacked on top of each other to estimate attribute profiles at different time points simultaneously using GNPC method.
3. LNPC method
   The algorithm estimates the stacked responses across all time points simultaneously using NPC method.
